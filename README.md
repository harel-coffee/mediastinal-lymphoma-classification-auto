# Machine-learning-based classification of bulky mediastinal lymphomas using radiomic features

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to reproduce the machine learning results shown in the paper "Characterization of Mediastinal Bulky Lymphomas with FDG-PET-Based Radiomics and Machine Learning Techniques" published on [Cancers **15** (2023) 1931](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15071931).

## Abstract

**Background:** This study tested the diagnostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT (FDG-PET) volumetric and texture parameters in the histological differentiation of mediastinal bulky disease due to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and grey zone lymphoma (GZL), using machine learning techniques. **Methods:** reviewed 80 cHL, 29 PMBCL and 8 GZL adult patients with mediastinal bulky disease and histopathological diagnoses who underwent FDG-PET pre-treatment. Volumetric and radiomic parameters were measured using FDG-PET both for bulky lesions (BL) and for all lesions (AL) using LIFEx software (threshold SUV ≥ 2.5). Binary and multiclass classifications were performed with various machine learning techniques fed by a relevant subset of radiomic features. **Results:** The analysis showed significant differences between the lymphoma groups in terms of SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV, TLG and several textural features of both first- and second-order grey level. Among machine learning classifiers, the tree-based ensembles achieved the best performance both for binary and multiclass classifications in histological differentiation. **Conclusions:** Our results support the value of metabolic heterogeneity as an imaging biomarker, and the use of radiomic features for early characterization of mediastinal bulky lymphoma.
